i believe in science. i'm rational. This may seem like a very odd question. if demons do exist 
( lets just say they do for the sake of argument ). If someone who is committing terrible acts to human beings, children, abusive, 
total contempt for humanity, hate,  how would you distinguish between someone with some kind of mental illness and
someone who is intentionally evil? Demonic if you like.

They would look petty similar. And i'm getting some bad vibes.

Just Wondering.
